My name is Roland, I'm a 18 year old student from Slovakia!

I'm good at making things, using clever techniques... for the most part. I made things that help others, things that millions of computers run daily, and even random things. You can find a tiny bit of what I've made here. :)

I might like cyber-security and programming a little bit too much. ;D
